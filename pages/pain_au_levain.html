    <h1>PAIN AU LEVAIN</h1>
    <h2>Sourdough Bread</h2>
    <p><strong>THIS BREAD IS SO ENPHATICALLY FRENCH</strong> that it retains its French name here. A stiff-textured levain is used to generate the fermentation. When baked the same day it is mixed, the bread has a delicate flavor, and open cell structure, and a beautiful russet cruxt. Retarding overnight is nor recommended, as many of the more graceful and delicate characteristics of the bread will be lost during the long cold time in refrigeration.</p>
    <h4>Overall Formula</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb, 14.4 oz of bread flour</li>
      <li>1.6 oz of medium rye flour</li>
      <li>1 lb, 4.6 oz of water</li>
      <li>.6 oz of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Levain Build</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4.6 oz of bread flour</li>
      <li>.3 oz of medium rye flour</li>
      <li>3 oz of water</li>
      <li>1 oz of mature culture (stiff)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Final Dough</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb, 9.8 oz of bread flour</li>
      <li>1.3 oz of medium rye flour</li>
      <li>1 lb, 1.8 oz of water</li>
      <li>.6 oz of salt</li>
      <li>7.9 oz of the levain</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>STIFF-TEXTURED LEVAIN:</strong> Make the final build approximately 12 hours before the final mix, and ley stand in a covered container at about 70 degrees Farenheit. During hot weather, or if the levain will ripen for longer than 12 hours the flour in the levain buildt can be salted at 1.8 percent to slow its activity.</li>
      <li><strong>MIXING:</strong> Add all the ingredients to the mixing bowl except the salt and the levain. In a spiral mixer, mix on first speed just until the ingredients are incorporated into a shaggy mass. Correct the hydration as necessary. Cover the bowl with plastic and ley stand for an autolyse phase of 20 to 60 minutes. At the end of the autolyse, sprinkle the salt over the surface of the dough, cut the levain into fist-sized chunks and place on top of the dough, and finish mixing on second speed for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. The dough should be supple, with a meidum consistency. Desied doughtemperature: 76 degrees Farenheit.</li>
      <li><strong>BULK FERMENTATION: </strong> 2 1/2 hours.</li>
      <li><strong>FOLDING:</strong> Fold the dough twice, at 50 minute intervals</li>
      <li><strong>DIVIDING AND SHAPING: </strong> divide the dough into 1.5 pound pieces; shape round or oblong.</li>
      <li><strong>FINAL FERMENTATION:</strong> Approximately 2 to 2 1/2 hours at 76 degrees Farenheit.</li>
      <li><strong>BAKING:</strong> With normal steam, 440 degrees Farenheit for 40 to 45 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
